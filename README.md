# Eat The Burger

> Order up and eat a new burger!

> Please note there will be a short delay for launching the application through Heroku

> mysql, express, ORM, JavaScript, handlebars 

"Eat The Burger" is more of an exercise in ORM than it is a useful application. The user has the ability to add a new burger to the menu, and then has the option to eat the burger. This information is stored into a MySQL database so that the data persists even if the user leaves the application. 

**The following was used to build this application**

- JavaScript
- Express
- Node.JS
- CSS
- HTML
- MySQL
- ORM
- Handlebars
